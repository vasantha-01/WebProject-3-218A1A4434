            <p>The use of fabric may be for: clothing, protection, cleaning, holding things, tying things, covering things, decorations, and communication. 
                Fabrics serve an inaugural part in history, and society would look a whole lot different if it was not for fabrics. 
                Fabric and textiles in general helped the trade between massive empires and assisted in shaping current societies.</p><hr>

                First, “fabric” is a material made by entwining fibers together. 
                Generally, a fabric is named after the fiber user to manufacture it; 
                some fabrics will even use a blend of different fibers. 
                The fabric is then named depending on the fiber(s) used, 
                its pattern and texture and the production process implemented. 
                Some fabrics also consider where the fibers originated from.
                Based off this, there are actually two sets of categories that first 
                separate the types of fabric: the fibers used (natural vs. synthetic) and the production processes (woven vs. knitted).
