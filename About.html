        <h3>Cotton</h3>
        <p>Cotton is produced from the cotton plant seed fiber and is a natural fiber. 
            Cotton is a popular crop, aiding in making cotton fabric less expensive than other natural fabrics. 
            Cotton is a versatile textile, and different weaving techniques can impart desired characteristics to cotton fabric. 
            Cotton can be used for voiles, laces, underwear, casual wear, velveteen, and heavy sailcloth. 
            The pros to using cotton include: being relatively inexpensive, comfortable, absorbent, and versatile. 
            The cons to using cotton include: it wrinkles easily, is sensitive to mildew, cotton boll is sensitive to environmental conditions, and the cotton plant has many pests and diseases. 
            Figure 1 is an example of cotton usage in the domestic environment:

        <h3>Lenin</h3>
        <p>
            Linen is a natural bast fiber produced from the flax plant stalk. 
            The bast fiber goes through extra steps to prepare the fiber to be spun into yarn. 
            Linen is a good conductor of heat and absorbs and expels moisture very quickly. 
            Linens are best used for towels, pillow casings, bed sheets, shirts, napkins, tablecloths, aprons, and diapers. 
            The pros to using linen include: being strong, drying quickly, and not being very elastic. 
            The cons to using linen include: time- and resource-intensive to produce, wrinkles easily, and the flax plant is finicky to grow. 
            Figure 2 is an example of linen usage:

        <h3>Silk</h3>
        <p>
            Silk is produced through sericulture. 
            Silk is the strongest natural fiber yet produces the smoothest natural fabrics. 
            Silk clothing includes: scarves, blouses, shirts, evening wear, parachutes, and sutures. 
            Silk can also be used for sheeting, pillowcases, and curtains. 
            The pros to using silk include: high breathability, light weight, and strength. 
            The cons include: being expensive to produce, being non-durable despite its strength, and wrinkles very easily.
